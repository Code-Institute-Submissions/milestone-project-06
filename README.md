# Milestone Project 01: User Centric Frontend Development
## Atiq Been Rahim - Portfolio

[View the live project here.](https://atiqbeenrahim.github.io/milestone-project-01/)

This is the User Centric Frontend Development project for Full Stack Software Developement course. I decided to make my own portfolio website because it will help me in future to promote myself. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential visitors and customers.

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about me.
        2. I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
        3. I want to look for the person's details and if the person in portfolio is experienced and trusted. I also want to locate his social media links to see his followings on social media to determine how trusted and known he is.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. I want to find information to contact with the person easily for the project or business prposal .
        3. I want to find his detailed in CV printable version.

    -   #### Frequent User Goals

        1. I want to check to see if there is any newly added experience or project he has done.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are Bootstrap 5 Warning and Dark (Black and Deep Yellow).
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Roboto Slab font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Roboto Slab is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate. Also used Baloo Tamma 2 font as secondary to give some styling and used Cursive as the fallback font.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. In the Hero section, I use my own image to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic. It will help me to promote myself and increase the trust of the customers.
